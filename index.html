    <p>
        Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently by managing revisions, branches, and merges. Git was initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel, but it has since become widely adopted across various industries and projects.
